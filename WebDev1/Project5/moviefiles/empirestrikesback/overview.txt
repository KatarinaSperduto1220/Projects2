Synopsis: The second entry in George Lucas' Star Wars trilogy finds Luke Skywalker, the green-as-grass hero from the first film, now a seasoned space warrior. Luke's Star Wars cohorts Han Solo and Princess Leia are likewise more experienced in the ways and means of battling the insidious Empire, as represented by the brooding Darth Vader. And, of course, "The Force," personified by the ghost of Luke's mentor Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness), is with them all. Retreating from Vader's minions, Luke ends up, at first, on the Ice Planet Hoth, and then the tropical Dagobah. Here he makes the acquaintance of the gnomish Yoda, whose all-encompassing wisdom comes in handy during the serial-like perils of the rest of the film. Before the film's open-ended climax, we are introduced to the apparently duplicitous Lando Calrissian and are let in on a secret that profoundly affects both Luke and his arch-enemy, Vader. Many viewers consider this award-winning film the best of the Star Wars movies, and its special-effects bonanza was pure gold at the box office.
